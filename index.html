  <p>
      The district was part of the Khandesh district with Dhule and Jalgaon till July 1998. According to some, khandesh means the country of Lord Krishna. The ancient name of this region is Rasika, when Nandurbar was also called Nandanagri after the name of its king Nandaraja.[3]

      The district is also rich with mythological accounts of the Ramayana, where the region is referred to as ‘Krushik’.
      
      The region is linked to various rulers of the time including Chalukyas, Vartakas and Yadavas.
      
      Prior to Mughal era, Khandesh formed the southern boundary of the Tughlaq Empire.
      
      Due to its strategic location at the ends of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, Nandurbar kept shifting into different power regimes. After the Mughal Empire's decline, the Marathas took control of Khandesh and subsequently on 3 June 1818 the Maratha Peshwa surrendered Khandesh to the British rule.
      
      Nandurbar had its own share in the Indian struggle for independence. It was here that during the Quit India Movement of 1942 Shirish Kumar, a mere boy of 15 years, lost his life by a gun shot. A small memorial has been erected in memory of Shirish Kumar in the square where he shed his blood.
