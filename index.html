      The district was part of the Khandesh district with Dhule and Jalgaon till July 1998. According to some, khandesh means the country of Lord Krishna. The ancient name of this region is Rasika, when Nandurbar was also called Nandanagri after the name of its king Nandaraja.[3]

      The district is also rich with mythological accounts of the Ramayana, where the region is referred to as ‘Krushik’.
      
      The region is linked to various rulers of the time including Chalukyas, Vartakas and Yadavas.
      
      Prior to Mughal era, Khandesh formed the southern boundary of the Tughlaq Empire.

      Due to its strategic location at the ends of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, Nandurbar kept shifting into different power regimes. After the Mughal Empire's decline, the Marathas took control of Khandesh and subsequently on 3 June 1818 the Maratha Peshwa surrendered Khandesh to the British rule.
      
      Nandurbar had its own share in the Indian struggle for independence. It was here that during the Quit India Movement of 1942 Shirish Kumar, a mere boy of 15 years, lost his life by a gun shot. A small memorial has been erected in memory of Shirish Kumar in the square where he shed his blood.

      History
The District Nandurbar is newly formed from the district Dhule. It came into existence with effect from 1st July 1998. Headquarter of this district is Nandurbar itself. The ancient name of this region was Rasika. Later under the Yadavas, it was called as Seunadesa after king Seunachandra who ruled over it. With the advent of Muslims, the name was changed to Khandesh to suit the title Khan given to the Faruki Kings. The entire area of Khandesh included two-district viz., Dhule and Jalgaon and was administered as one district with headquarters at Dhule. However in 1906 for administrative purposes the Khandesh was divided into two districts known as west Khandes and East Khandesh. In the year 1950, a new Tahsil Akkalkuwa was created and with the reorganization of states in 1956, the region was included in Bombay State and subsequently i.e. in 1960 it became a part of Maharashtra state. While doing so, 38 villages, each from Nandurbar and Nawapur tahsils, 43 villages from Talode and 37 villages from Akkalkuwa tahsils were transferred to Gujarat State. In 1971 Census, Akrani Mahal was upgraded as Akrani Tahsil. In 1961, the name of the district was changed from west Khandesh to Dhulia and later on to Dhule district with Dhule as its headquarters. In July 1998, after creation of Nandurbar district, 6 Tahsils comprising of 933 villages were transferred to Nandurbar district.Nandurbar district consists of six tahsils viz. Akkalkuwa, Akrani, Talode, Shahade, Nandurbar and Nawapur. There were 930 villages in 1991 Census, which rose to 947 with 17 new villages in 2001 Census. In 2011 census, the number of villages decreased to 943.
